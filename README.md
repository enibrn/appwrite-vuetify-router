# coround

“Coround” isn’t a standard English word. But let’s play with it a bit. Combining "core" and "round" could imply the central, most important part of something being fully formed or encapsulated in a rounded, complete way.

Imagine it representing a fundamental concept or essence that's whole and unbroken. It’s the core that stands out in its entirety—round and significant.
